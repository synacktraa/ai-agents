    "It will be responsible for:\n",

    "- Wrapping a function that must have exactly one parameter of a supported type (string, integer, float, boolean, list, dictionary, tuple, or set). If no type is specified for the parameter, it will be treated as a string. The function must also include a docstring that describes what it does.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Converting raw string inputs into the correct type before passing them to the wrapped function. For example, if the wrapped function expects an integer, the ReActTool will automatically convert string inputs like \"123\" into the integer 123.\n",

    "- Catches all exception raised by the associated function and returns a ExceptionInfo instead of just halting the execution. The exception info can be used by agent to understand what went wrong and how to fix it. This also helps in when defining the function, as we don't have to explicitly catch and handle exceptions."
